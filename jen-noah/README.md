# Project Name

**Author**: Your Name Goes Here
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are populating an admin page with author statistics using handlebar templates and js functions.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user has to add handlebars templates to the html, as well as initialize the admin page in the fetchAll function. They then need to add functions in the fetchAll functions for the data we want. The user will incorporate map() and reduce() in order to get the total authors and total words used from our Article constructor.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used javascript, html, css, json, and ajax in making this.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples: -->

9:00am - read instructions and determined driver/navigator

9:30am - looked at admin.html and added type to template the author-stats class

10:00am - worked on functionality for compiling handlebars and appending to DOM, and got super stuck, met with TA's to solve

12:00pm - working to get the functions within our fetchAll to work for getting our author Stats

12:30 - made README, and ACP'd final progress
